## 2026-06-03 — Halal Check Section UX Improvements (S134)

**What**: Removed dead `/halal` link from HalalTrustBanner, fixed banner position (above sections) on mobile, added tier badge to ExpandSection title, and moved TrustBadgesSection outside the Halal Check section.

**Why**: The dead link caused 404s (trust-eroding). The banner was below sections on mobile (inconsistent with modal and ADR). Users couldn't see verification depth without expanding the section. Trust badges mixed with halal verification confused information architecture.

**How**: Used Python for multi-line text replacements in TypeScript files (more reliable than sed for JSX). Key insights:
- `ExpandSection` takes `title: string`, so tier badge must be concatenated into a string — can't use ReactNode fragments without changing the component API
- `TrustBadgesSection` handles its own empty state — no wrapper condition needed when moving it outside ExpandSection
- Testing Library `getByRole('button', { name: '...' })` does exact match on accessible name — use regex when title is computed dynamically
- TypeScript `tsc` doesn't support the `/u` regex flag when targeting below ES6 — use plain regex instead
- The `/halal` route is referred to in translations and components but doesn't exist and isn't planned — consistent dead link audit needed across all locales

**Files changed**: 
- `src/components/providers/ProviderDetailPage.tsx` — banner position fix
- `src/features/providers/components/HalalTrustBanner.tsx` — dead link removal
- `src/features/providers/components/ProviderDetailSections.tsx` — tier badge + TrustBadgesSection move
- 4 test files updated for new behavior

**Next**: Consider reducing HalalTrustPopup view limit from 10 to 3, and audit other dead links in the app.

## 2026-06-04 — Checklist Redesign with Per-Item Icons (S134)

**What**: Redesigned the "What we verified" checklist from a framed `<ul>` with uniform `Check` icons to a frameless `DetailListItem`-style layout with per-item icons (`SquareMenu`, `BeerOff`, `PiggyBank`, `HalalIcon`).

**Why**: The old design had all items using the same `Check` icon inside a bordered frame, making it visually flat and indistinguishable from similar lists elsewhere. The new design uses distinct icons per verification type (menu, alcohol, pork, halal) matching the `DetailListItem` pattern already used in `ProviderDetailSections.tsx`.

**How**: 
- `hugeicons-react` has a `HalalIcon` component — but the same file already defined a local `function HalalIcon()` for the `GoldAttestationSection`. Import with alias (`import { HalalIcon as HugeHalalIcon } from 'hugeicons-react'`) to avoid naming conflicts with local definitions.
- Per-item icons require individual JSX per item — can't use a template/map loop when each item needs a different lucide icon. Each icon becomes an explicit `<div>` per item.
- When appending a colon outside `t()`, test assertions using `getByText` exact match break. Use `getByText(v => v.startsWith(...))` matcher instead.
- `tsc` passes with zero errors even when mixing icons from two different packages (lucide-react + hugeicons-react).

**Files changed**:
- `src/features/providers/components/ProofTierCard.tsx` — complete checklist rewrite
- `src/features/providers/components/__tests__/ProofTierCard.test.tsx` — test fix for colon
- `src/__tests__/features/providers/ProofTierCardQA.test.tsx` — test fix for colon
- `package.json` + `package-lock.json` — added `hugeicons-react` dependency

**Next**: None — session complete.
